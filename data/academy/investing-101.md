# Investing 101

Investing is the act of allocating resources, usually money, with the expectation of generating an income or profit. Common investment vehicles include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs. Diversification reduces risk by spreading investments across different assets.

## Key Concepts

- Compound interest: interest calculated on the initial principal and the accumulated interest.
- Risk vs Return: higher potential returns often come with higher risk.
- Asset allocation: the mix of stocks, bonds, and cash in a portfolio.
