# Tax Strategies

Tax strategies are methods to reduce tax liability legally. Common techniques include tax-advantaged accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s), tax-loss harvesting, and choosing tax-efficient investments like index funds.

## Examples

- Tax-loss harvesting: selling losing positions to offset realized gains.
- Roth vs Traditional IRA: Roth contributions are taxed now and withdrawals are tax-free; Traditional contributions are pre-tax and taxed on withdrawal.
